# Views

> Create views (pages) here

Views (pages) that use shared and proprietary components. Components that only exist within or utilized for that page - should keep them _scoped_ to the page.

```bash
.
└── views
    └── home
        ├── Index.vue
        ├── Section.vue
        └── components
            ├── CustomComponent.vue
            └── CustomComponentTwo.vue
```
